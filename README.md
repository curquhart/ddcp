About
-----
DDCP (Data Driven CodePipeline synthesizer) is designed to make dynamic CodePipeline
configuration trivial. It is currently in a POC-like state and only supports CodeCommit and CodeBuild.

Please see [Enhancement Issues](https://github.com/curquhart/ddcp/labels/enhancement) for planned features and to
submit any feature requests.
